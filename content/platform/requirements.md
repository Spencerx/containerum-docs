# Containerum requirements

Before installing Containerum make sure you have the following components:

- [Docker](/kubernetes/prerequisites)  
Note: if you have installed Kubernetes using [Containerum Kubernetes Package](/kubernetes), there's no need to install Docker.
- [Kubernetes](/kubernetes/) 1.5 or higher  
Note: You can also use [Let's Kube](https://github.com/containerum/letskube) utility to install the latest versions of Docker and Kubernetes on your VMs.  
- Helm
- Installed Kubernetes [Ingress Controller](https://github.com/containerum/containerum/blob/master/ingress.md)
